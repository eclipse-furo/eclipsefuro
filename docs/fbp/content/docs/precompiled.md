# @furo/precompiled

The [@furo/precompiled](https://github.com/theNorstroem/precompiled-furo-web-components) package is for those who want to use the furo componetnt directly in HTML.
There is no build step needed. It is a convenient way to use the components to prototype some ideas or just play around
with FBP without a complex installation procedure. When you know that your ideas work, transfer them 1:1 to a web component,
so others can install, use and extend them.

Look at the [sample](https://github.com/theNorstroem/precompiled-furo-web-components) folder in the repo to see an example of what is possible.

> **Note** This package was created to teach furo FBP and for creating our demos,
> so we can use and show our components in a HUGO generated page.
Some of the files are very big at the moment, because they are not optimized for file size yet.
 
This documentation uses @furo/precompiled at any place where you can see a `[demo/source/flow]` panel.
All that was needed was to load the precompiled scripts via CDN.
