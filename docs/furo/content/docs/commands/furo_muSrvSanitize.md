## furo muSrvSanitize

Sanitize the muServices, to avoid errors in your protos or es6 services.

Sanitizing includes at the moment:

- Adding of query params which are part of the url and needs to be listed as qp's for the request body.

*A method definition like:*
```yaml
    - md: 'Get: GET /sample/{smp} google.protobuf.Empty , sample.SampleEntity #Returns a single Sample.'

```

*will become to* 
```yaml
    - md: 'Get: GET /sample/{smp} google.protobuf.Empty , sample.SampleEntity #Returns a single Sample.'
      qp:
        smp: 'string #The query param smp stands for XXX id.'
```

*and you can change it to*
```yaml
    - md: 'Get: GET /sample/{smp} google.protobuf.Empty , sample.SampleEntity #Returns a single Sample.'
      qp:
        smp: 'string #The query param smp stands for a sample id.'
```


{{< hint info >}}
**Notice:** A existing query param will not be touched or modified.
