## furo genServiceProtos

Generate the service protos from the service specs.

The generated proto services will be generated to the configured path.

> As you may have noticed the specs have a attribute `targetfile` (`target` in ÂµServices, sorry). 
> Service specs with the same `targetfile` or `target` value will be generated in to the same proto file.


{{< hint danger >}}
**Attention:** You can not target Services and Messages to the same file, because for furo, the generating of types/messages and the generation of services are two different tasks.
