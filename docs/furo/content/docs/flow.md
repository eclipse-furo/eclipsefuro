# Working with Flows
Instead of calling each command of furo again and again, you can set up a flow which chains them together.

The config file from the init haves a preconfigured default flow.

 deprecated --> muSpec2Spec --> checkImports --> genMessageProtos --> genServiceProtos
{{< /mermaid >}}

## How to define a flow
The single commands of furo can be configured as a chain of commands. 


```yaml
flows:
  default: 
    - deprecated
    - muSpec2Spec
    - clean_dist
    - checkImports
    - genMessageProtos
    - genServiceProtos
  generate:
    - buf_generate
    - gen_transcoder
    - genEsModule
```

### Execute a flow
If you have a flow with the name *default** you can execute it, by just calling `furo` without any options. 
The same flow can be started with `furo run default`.

To start the flow with the name "generate", type in `furo run generate`.

**Note:** At the moment the flow runner jumps to the next command on any error of a sub command. This behavior may change in the future.

## How to define a custom command
You can add custom commands which can be integrated in a flow. A custom command is a link to an executable, this can be
a shell script or a command which is installed on your system. Make sure that you enter the correct paths.

Add your commands in the commands section of the config.
```yaml
commands: #camelCase is not allowed, command scripts can only be executed from a flow
  gen_transcoder: "./scripts/gprcgateway/generate.sh" # shell script to generate a grpc gateway mux.
  buf_generate: "./scripts/buf_generate.sh" # call buf with the configured options.
  buf_braking: "./scripts/buf_breaking.sh"
  clean_dist : "./scripts/cleanUpDist.sh" # Deletes the content of the dist folder
```

**Attention:** You can **not** use camelCase notation for the name of a custom command.

The commands that you have defined, can be used in any flow configuration.
