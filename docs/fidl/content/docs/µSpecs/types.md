# Anatomy of a type µSpec
The µType specs are regular yaml files.

The "type-object" contains 3 fields. The fields `type`, `fields` are mandatory, the field `target` is optional and autogenerated when ommited.

You can have as many type definitions per file as you want. It makes sense that you put types in a file, that belongs togehter. 



*File: muspec/sample.types.yaml*
```yaml
- type: 'sample.Sample #A sample type'
  fields:
    password: '* string:1 #The password.'
    username: '* string:2 #The username or email, or something to identify.'
    details: 'sample.Details:3 #Details.'
  target: sample.proto # this is "optional", if you omit this, Furo will use the package name (auth)

- type: 'sample.Details #A sample type'
  fields:
    birth_date: '* google.type.Date:1 #The birth date.'
    weight: '* number:2 #The weight.'    
    age: '- number:3 #Calculated field for displaying the age, because the calculations are very hard.'
  target: sample.proto 

```

## The type line

```yaml
- type: 'sample.Sample  #A sample type'
  !___!  !____||_____!  !____________!
    |       |     |          |
    |       |   type name    |
    |    package             |
    |                    description (recomended) begins with a #
    |                  
    | 
    | 
field name of the type


```

It is a good practice to give a good description of the type. 

## Fields

In the "fields-object", what a surprise, you define the fields / attributes of a type.

*minimalistic example*
```yaml
fieldname: '* string:2 #The description.'
!_______!  !_!!____!!_!!________________!
    |       |    |   |          |  
    |       |    |   |  description (recomended) begins with a #
 field name |    |   |   
            |    |  field id, indicated by a :   
            |    |  
            |   type  
            |     
       Indicator for required (*), readonly (-), repeated ([])

```

*example with default value and oneof*
```yaml
fieldname: '* string:2 = default value [oneofname] #The description.'
!_______!  !_!!____!!_!!______________!!__________!!________________!
    |       |    |   |          |            |              |   
    |       |    |   |          |   oneof definition in []  |
    |       |    |   |    default value (=)                 |
    |       |    |   |                                      |
    |       |    |   |        description (recomended) begins with a #
 field name |    |   |   
            |    |  field id, indicated by a :   
            |    |  
            |   type  
            |     
       Indicator for required (*), readonly (-), repeated ([])

```

### Fieldname
The name of the field

### Indicator for required
If the field is required, type in a *

### Indicator for readonly
If the field is readonly, type in a -

### Indicator for repeated
If the field is repeated, type in a []

### Type
Types are the same like in protobuf

### Field id
The field id must be unique, the generated protos use them too

### Default value
This does not reflect in the protos. 

### Oneof definition


### Description
It is a good practice to give a good description of the type. This description will go to the generated protos and other generates.
